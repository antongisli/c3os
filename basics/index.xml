      <description>C3OS comes as ISO and as a CLI which can be downloaded from the release page. The CLI setups k3s and is also used to automatically register nodes in a private, user-defined network.
Currently Alpine-based and openSUSE-based flavors are available, they both supports autonomous kubernetes bootstrapping with the c3os CLI.
C3OS nodes can also autonomously connect and configure each other via a P2P hybrid mesh, no network setup and no central server is needed in that case.</description>

By default, c3OS uses an immutable setup.
A running system will look like as follows:
/usr/local - persistent (COS_PERSISTENT) /oem - persistent (COS_OEM) /etc - ephemeral /usr - read only / immutable See also Elemental-toolkit docs.</description>
